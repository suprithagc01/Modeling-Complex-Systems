This simulation demonstrates how agent-based modeling can be used to
 study predator-prey dynamics. The introduction of a creek as a non-hunting
 zone alters population cycles, adding environmental constraints to the classi
cal Lotka-Volterra equations and making it a discrete model. The animation
 provides an interactive way to visualize the behavior of both rabbits and
 lynx over time.
